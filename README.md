# Smart-RPi-Clock
A smart clock for the Raspberry Pi and can be run on Windows. Shows weather, date, time, and news. Runs from Python 2.7 to 3.4.

## UPDATE


### NOTICE
#### This program currently does not work anymore because Dark Sky has disabled their API. I will make a brand new repo with fixed code and many new modifications. See you later!
